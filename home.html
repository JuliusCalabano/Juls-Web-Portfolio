                        <h4>About this work</h4>
                        <p>
                            This job is about assisting faculties whenerever they needed materials and medical and technical Equipment.
                            I also do technical Troubleshooting which is part of my job like fixing 
                            projector, tv, printer, laptop, connections, sound technicalities and etc.
                            I have a lot of adjustment here doing inventory because, at first I am not familiar with
                            different medical supplies and equipment that's why I have difficulties at the beginning.
                            But then I learned about it and I almost memorized all of the equipment like names and where are their location.
                            I learned that beginning will always be challenging but when time comes challenge will turns to normal things.
                            So, I have my Dean Dr. Dhenalyn A. Dejelo, she supervised the way I worked there but she is so amazing to the point
                            that she can handle multiple task at the same time. She taught me how to deal with challenges. She taught me how hardworking
                            person works in a worker. She helps me to build myself to prove that I am capable of doing more.
